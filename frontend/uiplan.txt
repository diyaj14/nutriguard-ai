# 🧠 DESIGN DIRECTION

### Theme Name:

**“AI Health Intelligence”**

### Core Visual Identity:

* Deep matte black background (#0B0F14)
* Teal / emerald AI accent (#16E0A0)
* Soft glass cards (blur + transparency)
* Floating AI visual element (abstract 3D neural food structure)
* Rounded edges everywhere (16–24px radius)
* Smooth micro-animations

---

# 📱 MOBILE-FIRST WEBSITE STRUCTURE

---

# 🔷 1️⃣ HERO SECTION (Landing Screen)

Inspired by your reference layout.

### Layout (Mobile First)

```
--------------------------------
[ LOGO ]           [ MENU ☰ ]

Healthy Intelligence Powered by AI

Personalized Food Suitability Engine

Scan. Analyze. Decide Better.

[ Scan Product ]   [ Try Demo ]

(3D animated neural food graphic)

↓ Scroll
--------------------------------
```

---

## ✨ WOW FACTOR #1 — Animated Neural Food Model

Instead of generic images:

* Use a rotating 3D neural mesh shaped like:

  * A leaf
  * A fruit
  * Or abstract molecule
* Particles flow across it like “data streams”
* Slight parallax effect on scroll

Tools:

* Three.js
* React Three Fiber

This makes it look biotech + AI.

---

# 🔷 2️⃣ HOW IT WORKS (AI Pipeline Section)

Dark background continues.

### Layout:

```
STEP 1
Scan Barcode
→ Live animation of barcode beam scanning

STEP 2
AI Extracts Nutrition Data
→ Data particles flow into neural core

STEP 3
Personalized Scoring Engine
→ Score dial animates to 78

STEP 4
Get Safer Alternatives
→ Cards slide upward
```

---

## ✨ WOW FACTOR #2 — Live AI Pipeline Animation

When user scrolls:

* Data moves visually from left to right
* Nutrition numbers morph into vectors
* Score dial animates dynamically

Feels like:
“AI is thinking”

---

# 🔷 3️⃣ LIVE SCORE PREVIEW (Interactive Demo Section)

This is your strongest UI moment.

---

### Layout:

```
[ Upload Image / Enter Barcode ]

---

## ✨ WOW FACTOR #3 — Circular Dynamic Score Orb

Instead of a static number:

* Glass orb
* Glowing neon edge
* Pulse animation
* Color changes based on score:

  * Green (80+)
  * Amber (60–80)
  * Red (<60)

Looks premium and futuristic.

3. Animated score orb
4. Risk meter
5. Glass biotech aesthetic
6. 3D neural food object
7. Explainable AI dashboard

It will feel:
Not like a student project.
But like a funded biotech startup.
