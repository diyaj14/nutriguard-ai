## 💡 THE 5 WOW FACTORS

### WOW #1: Claude AI Explanations
```
Generic: "High sodium, not good for your hypertension"
↓
AI-Powered: "This curry powder has 1200mg sodium. For your 
hypertension, that's 52% of your daily limit in one product. 
Try MDH instead—it has 950mg and tastes great with rice."
```
**Why it wins:** Feels human, not robotic. Judges will be amazed.

---

### WOW #2: Health Risk Prediction
```
You scan: Curry powder (1200mg sodium) + Snack (500mg sodium)
↓
App warns: "⚠️ This combination = 1700mg sodium. 
Your daily limit is 2300mg. You're already at 73%. 
Swap the snack for [low-sodium alternative]."
```
**Why it wins:** No other team will think of this. Game-changing.

---

### WOW #3: Smart Alternatives Recommender
```
You scan: "This product scores 6/10 for you"

• Local Brand - 9/10 (premium, 30% less sodium)
• Shan Spice Mix - 7/10 (quick alternative)"
```
**Why it wins:** Actually helpful, semantic search shows intelligence.

---

### WOW #4: Stunning UI with Animations
```
Scanning Product
↓
[Animated loading pulse]
↓
[Score circle reveals with bounce animation]
"You Got: 8/10 ✅"
↓
[Factors slide in one by one]
↓
[Alternatives fade in]
```
**Why it wins:** Beauty matters. Judges remember visual experiences.

---

### WOW #5: Learning User Patterns
```
After 5 scans:
"📈 Your Shopping Improvement: +35%
You're choosing 25% more high-protein items 
(great for your fitness goal!)
💡 Insight: Your average score went from 6.2/10 to 7.8/10
