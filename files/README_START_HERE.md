           │ 
0:30-1:30  │ SCENARIO 1: Health Condition
           │ Demo: Scan 5 curry powders → Ranked scores
           │ "In 20 seconds, she made a healthier choice"
           │
1:30-2:30  │ SCENARIO 2: Allergy Safety
           │ Demo: Scan snack → Safe/Unsafe alert

           │
2:30-3:30  │ SCENARIO 3: WOW MOMENT
           │ Demo: Cart analysis → Health risks detected

           │ "India needs this. Let's build it together."
           │
4:00-5:00  │ Questions answered with confidence
           │
5:00       │ JUDGE REACTION: "WOW. How did you build this?"

## ✅ JUDGING CRITERIA (What Wins)

| Criteria | Weight | You're Winning When |
|----------|--------|-------------------|
| **Functionality** | 25% | OCR >85%, scoring works, no crashes |

| **UX** | 20% | Beautiful, fast, smooth |
| **Feasibility** | 15% | Scales to real supermarkets |
| **Impact** | 10% | Genuinely helps health decisions |
| **Code Quality** | 10% | Clean, documented, maintainable |

**Your Strategy:** Excel at first 3 (65% base) + 5 WOW factors = WIN

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### #1: MVP First, WOW Factors Second
- Don't build everything at once (fragile)
- Build working MVP in 8 hours (solid)
- Then add WOW factors (unbeatable)

### #2: Beautiful UI Matters
- 20% of judging is UX
- Animated score circles > boring numbers
- Smooth transitions > instant jumps
- Color-coded (green/yellow/red) > monochrome

### #3: Genuine Personalization
- Generic: "This is healthy"
- Personalized: "For YOUR hypertension, this is good because..."
- That's the difference between good and GREAT

### #4: Demo is Half the Battle
- Practice 10+ times (not just once)
- Know your script but don't read it
- Show 3 different scenarios
- Have backup video ready

### #5: Emotional Connection
- Don't pitch features ("It has machine learning")
- Pitch impact ("She now buys with confidence")
- Tell a story with your personas
- Make judges care about the problem

## 📞 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "This seems complex"
→ Start with SUMMARY_AND_NEXT_STEPS.md, not the full strategy
→ Break it into phases (you have 24 hours)
→ Each phase is achievable in 6-8 hours

### "I don't have a team"
→ Solo development is possible with no-code tools
→ Or find teammates at the kickoff
→ Or partner with others

### "My tech stack is different"
→ The blueprint works with any stack
→ Same phases, same WOW factors
→ Adapt the code examples to your tech

### "What if demo fails?"
→ Have backup video ready (mandatory)
→ Have screenshots (mandatory)
→ Be ready to explain via code (backup)
→ Worst case: still win with innovation
